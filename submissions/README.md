# Submissions (Pull Request)

**Your submission must be a single file named exactly: `challenge_submission.csv`**

- Place it in this folder: **`submissions/challenge_submission.csv`**
- Only this filename is evaluated; other CSV files in `submissions/` are ignored.
- Your **leaderboard name** is your **GitHub username** (one entry per participant).
- You can update your submission by pushing new commits (replace `challenge_submission.csv`).
- Do **not** put your file in `submissions_examples/` — that folder is for examples only and is never evaluated.

Format: columns `user_id`, `snapshot_id`, `predicted_role` (see main README).
